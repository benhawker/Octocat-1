A git branch allows you to make changes to files, commit and push those changes, without affecting the files in other branches.  The default branch is the master branch, but you can create other branches in a repository both locally and remotely.  When in these branches any changes you make will be saved to the branch, but not to the other branches.  This was you can have multiple versions of the files with different changes, allowing you to test which version works best.  When you decide on which version you prefer, you can merge that branch version with the master branch.
